# How to run
1. Execution environment

    - This project use [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage and install python dependencies. 
    - To install all the prerequisite packages at once, run `poetry install` in the root directory.
    - To run the project program within the pre-defined environment, run `poetry run python ${PROGRAM_NAME}`.
    - To activate the virtual environment in a shell, run `poetry shell`.

2. Configuration
    - In order to use the OpenAI API, ensure that your API key is added to the `src/settings/config.py` file prior to running the program.
        ```python
        class Configuration:
            OPENAI_API_KEY = "${KEY_SHOULD_BE_ADDED}"
            OPENAI_MODEL_NAME = "gpt-3.5-turbo"
            EMBEDDING_MODEL_NAME = "intfloat/e5-large-v2"
        ```

3. Run
    ```sh
    python src/app.py --data ${DATA} --outfile ${OUT_FILE_NAME} --num_test {NUM_TEST}
    ```
    - `DATA` : You have three options for the dataset to use: `WebQSP`, `mintaka`, or `ComplexWebQ`.
    - `OUT_FILE_NAME` : The name of the output file. Default value is `evaluation_resultc.csv`.
    - `NUM_TEST` : Number of samples to test. Default value is 500.

    - example
      ```sh
      python src/app.py --data WebQSP --outfile webqsp_results.csv --num_test 500
      ```
